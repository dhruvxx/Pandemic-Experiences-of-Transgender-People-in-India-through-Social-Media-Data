# Pandemic-Experiences-of-Transgender-People-in-India-through-Social-Media-Data
 In this project, I will be reviewing “No Outlaws in the Gender Galaxy” (Shah et al., 2015) along with around 10 articles on the pandemic experiences of the transgender communities in India. The purpose of this review is to understand the key questions that have been posed and addressed in the scholarship on transgender people in the context of the pandemic.

The project will aim to do the following :
* To understand what are the most widely shared pandemic experiences of transgender people in India on social media
* To assess and analyse what the realities of transgender people have been during the pandemic, and what that reveals about their place in the Indian polity
* To gauge how effective the use of computational tools is in the study of gender, particularly in the context of marginalized communities
